# This function has to be defined by the user depending on the property defined.
# In this case we have just implemented a simple and general function which
# updates the predicates if it finds the topic in the list of predicates.
# Since the property is defined on predicates, we need this function to update the
# predicates each time a message is observed. This abstraction of course is totally
# dependent on the specific application.
