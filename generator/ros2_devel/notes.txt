# Finalising ROS(2)Monitoring

## Creating a new ros ws

1. Make a new directory and a src subfolder

## Creating the MonitorError package 

this is an interface in ROS2 and it's going to be a c++ package 

1. ``` ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake rosmonitoring_interfaces ```

2. in here create a msg folder (not in the package src but in the package folder)

3. make changes to package.xml and cmakelists 

4. build 

## Create the monitor package 

follow the py_pubsub 
then the interfaces part 
things that you must add to the package.xml 

``` <exec_depend>rosmonitoring_interfaces</exec_depend> ```




so now we've got the basic structure down 

now we work on automating stuff 

## To automate 

1. adding msg types to package.xml 
2. adding monitor script names to setup.py
